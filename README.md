# SE_Project_React

### `Decription`

Using the technologies and functionalities exclusive to React, I was able to create an application that presents the user with viable pieces of clothing the user can wear depending on the weather. Each of the garments have been assigned the weather ideal to be used in, which is what the application uses to deduce what clothes to display to the user.

### `Technologies and Techniques`

Contrary to what I used on my last project, this project I used hooks available to developers using React. Specifically, I used useState() and useEffect().

An API from [weathermap.org](weathermap.org) was used for the application to get weather data from a specified longitude and latitude.

### `Screenshots`

The application offers a user-friendly, aesthetically-pleasing user interface that makes it easy for anyone to "pick up" my app and maneuver their way throughout the application,
