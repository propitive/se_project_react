When the user is logged off, the user will not see any cards. Rather, the user will only be able to see the current temperature of the specified city, the "log in" button, and the "sign up" button.

#### Invalid Inputs in Form

When the user is logged in and on the main page, the user will see all of the cards created, the name of the current user, and the specified avatar of the user. The option to add a new card will be made available to the user. The current user may also like any cards the user wishes to like.

#### Signed In - Profile Page

#### Item Modal Open

When the user clicks on any card, a modal will appear that will expand the clothing item and present the user with the name of the clothing item, the weather the clothing item's respective creator specified, and the delete button. Only the clothing item's respective creator is able to delete the card.
